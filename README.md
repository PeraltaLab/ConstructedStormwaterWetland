functions in a constructed stormwater wetlan. *[biorxiv pre-print](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.020776)*  

Raw sequence files can be found at NCBI SRA [BioProject ID PRJNA613095](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA613095).

## We address the following questions

* **Aim:** How can wetland design be optimized to enhance ecosystem services and reduce ecosystem disservices?

### Repo Contents

* **analyses:** An R Markdown file that includes R script written by Regina Bledsoe, Ariane Peralta, and Mario Muscarella containing functions used in analysis of GHG, soil, and microbial sequence data.

* **bin:** 
	* *MothurTools.R*: An R script written by Mario Muscarella (Indiana University, now at University of Illinois) containing functions used in the analysis of community sequence data.

* **data:** Files associated with GHG, soil, and microbial data sets. 

* **figures:** Figures (of GHG, soil, microbes) generated according to R script located in R Markdown file.

* **mothur:** Files containing script for bioinformatic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences (Illumina MiSeq platform) using mothur pipeline.
